why middle is not type modifier?

 adjective subjects mark up: 101: <m><b>basal</b></m> and <m>proximal</m> <m><b>cauline</b></m> ;

 adjective subjects mark up: 128: <m>outer</m> <m>sterile</m> , <n>corollas</n> <b>expanded</b> , raylike , bilateral , <b>5</b> – many_lobed ;

Knows inner is a modifier: inner phyllaries.
From
388	42.txt-1	middle phyllaries acute to short_acuminate at apex with point 10 – 21 mm and spine tip 2 – 5 ( – 6 ) mm , distal margins with prominent yellowish margins 0 . 5 – 1 + mm .

knows middle is a modifer: middle phyllaries


From (inner/middle) phyllaries, and inner florets
716	704.txt-12	inner florets 30 – 55 ;	Inner (functionally staminate) florets 30–55;	inner florets NUMBER	normal	floret	inner	\N

knows inner/middle is a type modifier.

From the following pattern (type modifier-character state)

knows inner may be used as an adjective subject.

Then we can infer fertile is a character state:

Then we can infer outer can play a similar role as middle:

We can infer "bases" "ligules" are a structure

we can infer more boundary words.
