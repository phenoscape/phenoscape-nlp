why middle is not type modifier?

 adjective subjects mark up: 101: <m><b>basal</b></m> and <m>proximal</m> <m><b>cauline</b></m> ;

 adjective subjects mark up: 128: <m>outer</m> <m>sterile</m> , <n>corollas</n> <b>expanded</b> , raylike , bilateral , <b>5</b> – many_lobed ;

knows inner/middle is a type modifier.

From the following pattern (type modifier-character state)

knows inner may be used as an adjective subject.

Then we can infer fertile is a character state:

Then we can infer outer can play a similar role as middle:
