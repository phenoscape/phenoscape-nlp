Lebediorthis (genus name) , erected for specimens from the Lower Ordovician of Siberia ( Gorno Altai ) , was assigned by its author to the Cremnorthidae notwithstanding the absence of a differentiated cardinal process and a high dorsal median septum , which are diagnostic of that family ;	

Linoproductids with thin spines on dorsal corpus ;
	
>>>>>>>> non-descriptive sentences:

"nomen dubium ;" latin: doubtful name.

requires revision ;

differs from ...

said to differ from Taeniothaerus by having longer interarea , thicker ventral spines , and ventral diductor scars that enclose adductor scars more closely anteriorly ;

No diagnosis provided for genus or type specimen ;

otherwise like Poikilosakos ;

other specimens simply curving laterally , open anteriorly ;

recent species with dendroid shell punctation ;

Characters as for suborder ;

possibly juvenile of Eosiphonotreta ;

Resembles Chonosteges , but lacks the complex spine , funnel arrangement bordering the corpus cavity ;

Similar to Platystrophia but with a fine costellate ornamentation commonly superimposed on coarsely costate arrangement of Platystrophia ;

closely resembles Marginatia ;

abnormal genus , only ventral valves known ;

No description or diagnosis of genus provided ;

family designation uncertain because dorsal interior unknown , but ventral muscle field typically leptostrophiid in its posterolateral bounding ridges and in its triangularity ;

Liang placed in his new order , the Punctoproductida , with endopunctae but no pseudopunctae , along with the Dipunctellidina ( = Permianellins in the Lyttoniidae ) ;
