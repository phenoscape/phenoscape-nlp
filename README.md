Source for EQ-Generating CharaParser application, which uses unsupervised lexicon learning and natural language processing to propose EQ-based phenotype annotations.
It is useful for character descriptions written in the style similar to the example below:

Distal end of cleithrum

1.is not bifurcate, bearing only an anterior process

2.bifurcate

The input to EQ-Generating CharaParser is

1. character descriptions in NeXML format

2. a (may be empty) glossary of the related domain

3. ontologies for EQs

The software is currently under development as part of the Phenoscape project (http://phenoscape.org/).
