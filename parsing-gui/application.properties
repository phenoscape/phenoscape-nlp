application.instructions=Start from General, go through each tab (i.e. step) to complete the parsing process of a volume of\r\nFNA. \
Save configuration information entered on General tab so next time it can be simply loaded.\r\nTo continue work from the tab where you\
 left last time, load configuration information and jump \r\n the tab. Repeatedly run Verification until there is no error reported\
  before proceeding to\r\nTransformation. It's good to do so for other steps that need expert intervention.

step1DescpPart1=Step 1 segments a volume to individual treatments. Use 'File Link' to open a file for review. If segmentation errors are spotted (only happens rarely), correct segmentations in ProjectFolder/target/extracted

step1DescpPart3= and rerun this step by clicking 'Clear & Rerun'. 
step2DescpPart1=Step 2 verifies the results of step 1. If an error is reported here, correct it by editing the file in ProjectFolder/target/extracted
step2DescpPart2=. Use 'File Link' to open a file for editing. Rerun this step by clicking on 'Clear & Rerun' repeatedly until no error is reported.
step3DescpText=Loading source files. Use 'File Link' to open a file for review and edit if needed. Save corrected files to ProjectFolder/target/transformed.
step4Descp=CharaParser is learning/discovering structure names and character descriptors. When it is completed, you will see "Done" in the message box below. Then use the sub-tabs to review and categorize terms. 
step4Descp1=Structures = organs/parts (including "midline" of ..., the "connection" between ... ) in noun (e.g., anus) or adjective (e.g., anal) forms, taxon names, pronouns referring to any of the above. Descriptors = character state terms (including adjectives and intransitive verbs used in this sense). Neither = Character terms (e.g.,size, proportions), transitive verbs, adverbs, and other terms that doesn't describe a character directly (e.g.,"general", "ditto", "leave" the "freedom" for ...).
step4Descp2=Structures = organs/parts (including "midline" of ..., the "connection" between ... ) in noun (e.g., anus) or adjective (e.g., anal) forms, taxon names, pronouns referring to any of the above. Descriptors = character state terms (including adjectives and intransitive verbs used in this sense). Neither = Character terms (e.g.,size, proportions), transitive verbs, adverbs, and other terms that doesn't describe a character directly (e.g.,"general", "ditto", "leave" the "freedom" for ...).
step4Descp3=Structures = organs/parts (including "midline" of ..., the "connection" between ... ) in noun (e.g., anus) or adjective (e.g., anal) forms, taxon names, pronouns referring to any of the above. Descriptors = character state terms (including adjectives and intransitive verbs used in this sense). Neither = Character terms (e.g.,size, proportions), transitive verbs, adverbs, and other terms that doesn't describe a character directly (e.g.,"general", "ditto", "leave" the "freedom" for ...).
step4Descp1.alt=Click on 'Load Task' to start. CharaParser categorized these terms as structure terms. Please review/edit the categorization of the terms. Please treat "ditto" and general living habit and life style terms (e.g., "annuals") as structures. 
step4Descp2.alt=Click on 'Load Task' to start. CharaParser categorized these terms as character terms. Please review/edit the categorization of the terms. Please note transitive verbs are not characters. 
step4Descp3.alt=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Please categorize these terms for CharaParser. 
step4Descp1.old=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Select all non-structure terms, then click 'Mark as Bad'. Then click 'Mark Others as Good'. Then click 'Save Decisions'. Treat "ditto" and general living habit and life style terms (e.g., annuals) as structure terms.
step4Descp2.old=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Select all non-descriptor terms, then click 'Mark as Bad'. Then click 'Mark Others as Good'. Then click 'Save Decisions'. Treat verbs as non-descriptors.
step4Descp3.old=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Select all structure terms, then click 'Mark as Good'. Then click 'Mark Others as Bad'. Then click 'Save Decisions'. Treat "ditto" and general living habit and life style terms (e.g., annuals) as structure terms. 
step4Descp4.old=Click on 'Load Task' to start. Select all descriptor terms, then click 'Mark as Good'. Then click 'Mark Others as Bad'. Then click 'Save Decisions'. Treat verbs as non-descriptors.   
step5Descp=Step 5 allows you to load sentences for manual markup. Click on Load Task to start. Select a sentence and then select/enter appropriate modifier and tag for the sentence. Click 'Apply to Checked' to update the sentence table shown. Use "ignore" to tag non-morphological description sentences. 'Save Tagged Sentences' to save your work.    
step6DescpText=Here are the terms whose category is unknown to the parser. They are presented to you by group. Please go through these groups one by one to give them a good category label. You may remove terms from a group by clicking the "x" next to a term.  
step7DescpText=Text are being processed and annotated to generate EQ statements. Files annotated in XML will be listed below. Use 'File Link' to open a file for review and edit. Save correct files to ProjectFolder/target/final. Complete EQ output is in MySql database
